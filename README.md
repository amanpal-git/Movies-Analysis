# IMDb Movie Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze IMDb movie data using Python along with key data analysis libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The primary objective of this project is to explore and visualize various aspects of movie data, including ratings and gross earnings.

## Getting Started

Before running the project, make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn


## Project Structure

The project is organized into several sections:

### Data Import

The data is imported from a CSV file using the Pandas library. The dataset contains information about movie titles, release years, runtimes, genres, ratings, and gross earnings.

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning the dataset. This includes removing duplicate entries and checking for any missing values. Additionally, column names are refined for better clarity.

### Data Analysis and Visualization

The project involves various analyses and visualizations:

1. **Highest Rated Movies:** Movies with ratings above 8.5 are identified and visualized using box plots and bar plots.
2. **Top Grossing Movies:** The top 10 highest grossing movies are determined and presented through bar plots.
3. **Top Rated Movies:** The top 10 highest rated movies are selected and visualized using bar plots.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary libraries using the provided command.
2. Clone or download this project repository.
3. Replace the file path in the data import step with the actual path of your CSV file.
4. Execute the script and observe the generated plots to gain insights from the data.

## Acknowledgments

The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from IMDb and is intended strictly for educational purposes. The analysis and visualizations serve as demonstrations of data manipulation and visualization skills.
